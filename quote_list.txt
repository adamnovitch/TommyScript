You know what they say, love is blind
In a few minutes, bitch
You're tearing me apart
You know what they say, two is ok but three is a crowd
here you go, keep the change, hi doggie
Keep your stupid comments in your pocket
you're just a chicken, cheep cheep cheep
so anyways how is your sex life
i cannot tell you it's confidential
we're expecting
anything for my princess
Oh hi
What a story
Let's go home
I did not
That's the idea
It's bullshit
